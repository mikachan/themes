Kaze is a WordPress block theme built using the Site Editor and TailwindCSS. It uses the TailwindCSS Node.js package to remove any unused classes from the final CSS file, so it's as lightweight as possible.

Run `npm run dev` to build the CSS file whilst you're editing the theme.

Run `npm run build` to build the final CSS file.
